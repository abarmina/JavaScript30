      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      console.log(players, team5);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Dan",

      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(captain, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { quantity: 50, number: 2 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const person3 = {...person};
      person3.color = 'red';
      console.log(person, person3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
